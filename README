unpapp
======

PerlApp 4.1 extraction utility.

unpapp is a tool that helps recover Perl code from
Windows executables that were originally created with
ActiveState PerlApp.

It is intended as a recovery tool for poor souls who
accidentally deleted their source code and didn't keep
a backup.

It is NOT meant for stealing code that you don't own
the copyright or usage rights of.


Thanks to https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=394546
for finding out how PerlApp obfuscates data.

Instead of trying to brute-force extract useful data,
unpapp actually parses and extracts the exe file and
the data structures contained within.

No code was reverse engineered for this, everything
was simply figured out from analysing the encoded data.


unpapp is released under a permissive, 2-clause BSD
